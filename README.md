pragmods
========

Code for analyses and models of pragmatic reference game experiments. Used for Frank et al. (under review). "Rational speech act models of pragmatic reasoning in reference games."

A cleaned-up version of the code used for collecting the data is available at [https://github.com/langcog/pragmods_expts](). The `rrrsa` package for using the RSA model with these data is available at [https://github.com/benpeloquin7/rrrsa]().

## Other experiments

Note that there are two sequences of experiments that are not included in the submitted paper (primarily for reasons of space). These are analyzed in `analysis/4-sequences` and `analysis/5-speakers`.
