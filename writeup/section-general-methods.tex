\section{General Methods}

Our goal was to create a general method for measuring pragmatic inferences in simple reference games. Our taking-off point were previous studies by \citeA{frank2012} and \citeA{stiller2014}, in which simple feature-based displays allowed the measurement of how participants' judgments 


\subsection{Samples}

We converged quickly on a general standard of 50 participants per cell, based on the tradeoff between cost and the desired precision of the estimates on our measurements. See SI for simulations showing estimated confidence intervals on a forced-choice measure. 

All of the experiments described here were run on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service, between Fall 2013 and FIXME. 


\subsection{Items}




Minor stuff:

Prelims measures has four items

Size and sequence have no manipulation check
