\abstract{Human communication is almost always underspecified. Nevertheless, most communication takes place in a context where otherwise ambiguous messages can be decoded. A key part of this process of pragmatic disambiguation for a listener is reasoning about the speaker's intentions; but a smart speaker will consider what kind of reasoning the listener is going to do and design her message with that in mind. A variety of recent work on formal pragmatics has made use of recursive systems of this type, based on a generalized notion of ``signaling systems.'' Here we show that these systems can be written as special cases of a probabilistic recursive reasoning model, with a small number of choice-points, including the depth of the recursion possible for human communicators and whether they interpret messages greedily. We present experimental data that bear on these decisions.}
