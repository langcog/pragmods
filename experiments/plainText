Click on the Christmas tree you think is Bob's favorite.

You have $100 you can use to bet on the sundaes you think may be Bob's favorite, by distributing your $100 among the options. In other words, distribute the money among the options according to how likely you think each option is to be Bob's favorite. Make sure your bets add to $100.

Original version:
You have $100 you can use to bet on the friends you think may be Bob's favorite, by distributing your $100 among the options. In other words, distribute the money among the options according to how likely you think each option is Bob's favorite. Make sure your bets add to $100.


Edited version (after the first two rounds of experiments):
You have $100 you can use to bet on the friends you think may be Bob's favorite: Distribute your $100 among the options by how likely you think that each of the options is Bob's favorite. (Make sure your bets add to $100).

In a scale from 1 to 7, for each friend choose the level of confidence that you have that it is Bob's favorite. Here 1 means "very confident that it is not his favorite", 7 means "very confident that it is his favorite" and 4 means that you are not sure one way or the other.


Bob can only say one word [to communicate with you]

Start with the level 1 matrix

	0) If necessary set the Java stuff:

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/Home

	1) Add to the experiment_timeline doc what you will do

	2) change the variables in parameter_setter

	3) change the variables in settings_c1.txt

	4) Run the submiterator

python submiterator.py settings_c1.txt

	5) Update the code online

	### Updating All ### (or just part, if you want)
scp -r * nc07agom@cardinal.stanford.edu:/afs/ir/group/langcog/WWW/expts/pragmods

	6) Post the HIT

sh pragmods_c1-postHIT.sh

	7) Retreive the results

sh pragmods_c1-getResults.sh

	8) Add to experiment timeline the info you get. 

	9) Take pragmods_c1.results.tst and make a copy of it where you want it and rename it there with a good description

The condition without base rates
No familiarization slide at all. No previous reference to Bob
"Take a look at these friends!"
label_html += '<p class="block-text">You have $100 you can use to bet on the friends you think may be Bob\'s favorite: Distribute your $100 among the options by how likely you think that each of the options is Bob\'s favorite. (Make sure your bets add to $100).</p>';

This that causes turkers to distribute bets almost equally between the target and the logical:

########################
c1 November 17th 2013
Familiarization does include: 
"Meet Bob:  Bob
Bob really likes to visit friends. 
Every Sunday he chooses to visit a friend."
The test slide has "Take a look at these friends Bob has visited!"


You have $100 you can use to bet on the friends you think may be Bob's favorite. Distribute your $100 among the options by how likely you think that each of the options is Bob's favorite. (Make sure your bets add to $100).


Tentative future wording:
You have $100 you can use to bet on Bob's friends by how likely you think each one of them is Bob's favorite. Distribute your $100 in the fields below the options by how likely you think that each of the options is Bob's favorite. (Make sure your bets add to $100).






## Include image of Bob in the check question
## Increase the font size of Bob
## Labeling the stimulus as A,B,C and then ask for the input on bottom   -> Between the explanation and the next button

## Compare all of the simulus - 50 in each conditon



# This was in the CSS for some reason or other... who knows.
