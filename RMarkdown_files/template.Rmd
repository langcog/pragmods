This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

---
title: 
author: 
date: 
---

```{r}
# Basic study statistics: Number of participants, dates when it was ran, bugs and issues present in the study, reasons to be concerned that the data is unreliable, etc.
```

```{r}
# All the data pre-procesing. E.g. merging CSV files, adding features from excel sheets, determine if choices were correct
```

```{r}
# Statistical analysis - (regressions, anova, chi square, factor analysis, etc.)
```

```{r}
# Visualization - the reason this is after statistical analysis is that some properties of the graphs (e.g. a regression line or confidence intervals) are in themselves statistical analysis computed in the previous section
```

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
